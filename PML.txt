Model selected : knn / gbm
Preprocess : PCA
train control parameters : repeatedCV, repeats CV

knn : I selected KNN for using example data to build the model and using similarity with example data during prediction of the new dataset.

PCA : Eliminated the input parameters with zero variability with nzv analysis and then used PCA with 0.9 thresholdto  reduce no. of input variables for training.

Repeated CV: In training used repeated CV to control out of sample errors.
